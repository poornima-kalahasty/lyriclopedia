  <h2><u>Liar</u></h2>
  
<p>I don't care if you're here
<br>Or if you're not alone
<br>I don't care, it's been too long
<br>It's kinda like it didn't happen
<br>The way that your lips move
<br>The way you whisper slow
<br>I don't care, it's good as gone</p>

<p>Uh, I said I won't lose control
<br>I don't want it
<br>I said I won't get too close
<br>But I can't stop it</p>

<p>Oh no, there you go
<br>Making me a liar
<br>Got me begging you for more
<br>Oh no, there I go
<br>Startin' up a fire
<br>Oh no, no
<br>Oh no, there you go
<br>Making me a liar
<br>I kinda like it though
<br>Oh no, there I go
<br>Startin' up a fire
Oh no, no</p>

<p>They're watching, I feel it
<br>I know I shouldn't stay
<br>I picture your hands on me
(I think I wanna let it happen)
<br>But what if you kiss me?
<br>And what if I like it?
<br>And no one sees it</p>

<p>I said I won't lose control
<br>I don't want it
<br>I said I won't get too close
<br>But I can't stop it</p>

<p>Oh no, there you go
<br>Making me a liar
<br>Got me begging you for more
<br>Oh no, there I go
<br>Startin' up a fire
Oh no, no
<br>Oh no, there you go
Making me a liar
<br>I kinda like it though
<br>Oh no, there I go
Startin' up a fire
<br>Oh no, no</p>

<p>Oh no, no, no
Here comes trouble, no, no
Startin' up a fire</p>

<p>I don't believe myself when I
Say that I don't need you
<br>I don't believe myself when I
Say it, so don't believe me</p>

<p>Oh no, there you go
Making me a liar
<br>Got me begging you for more
<br>Oh no, there I go
Startin' up a fire
<br>Oh no, no
<br>Oh no, there you go
Making me a liar
<br>I kinda like it though
Oh no, there I go
<br>Startin' up a fire
Oh no, no</p>

<p>(Yeah, yeah)
<br>Oh no, no, no
<br>Oh no, no, no
<br>Oh no, you're making me a liar
<br>'Cause your clothes are on the floor
<br>Another fire</p>
