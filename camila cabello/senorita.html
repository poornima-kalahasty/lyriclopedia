<h2><u> Senorita </u></h2>

<p>I love it when you call me Senorita
<br>I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
<br>But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
<br>It's true la-la-la
<br>Ooh, I should be running
<br>Ooh, you keep me coming
<br>For ya</p>

<p>Land in Miami
<br>The air was hot from summer rain
<br>Sweat dripping off me
<br>Before I even knew her name la-la-la
<br>It felt like ooh-la-la-la
Yeah, no</p>

<p>Sapphire moonlight
<br>We danced for hours in the sand
Tequila Sunrise
<br>Her body fit right in my hands, la-la-la
<br>It felt like ooh-la-la-la
Yeah</p>

<p>I love it when you call me Senorita
<br>I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
<br>But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
<br>It's true la-la-la
<br>Ooh, I should be running
<br>Ooh, you keep me coming for ya</p>

<p>When you call me Senorita
<br>I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
<br>But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
<br>It's true la-la-la
<br>Ooh, I should be running
<br>Ooh, you keep me coming
For ya</p>

<p>Locked in the hotel
<br>There's just some things that never change
<br>You say, "We're just friends."
<br>But friends don't know the way you taste-la-la-la
<br>'Cause you know it's been a long time comin'
<br>Don't you let me fall, oh</p>

<p>Ooh, when your lips undress me
<br>Hooked on your tongue
<br>Ooh, love, your kiss is deadly
<br>Don't stop</p>

<p>I love it when you call me Senorita
<br>I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
<br>But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
<br>It's true la-la-la
<br>Ooh, I should be running
<br>Ooh, you keep me coming for ya</p>

<p>All along I'll be coming for ya (for ya)
<br>And I hope it meant something to ya
<br>Call my name, I'll be comin' for ya (comin' for ya)
<br>Comin' for ya (comin' for ya)</p>

<p>For ya, for ya (oh, she loves it when I call her), for ya
<br>Ooh, I should be running
<br>Ooh, you keep me coming
<br>For ya</p>
