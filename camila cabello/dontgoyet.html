    <h2><u>Don't go yet</u></h2>
    <p>Oh, my love, oh, yeah, yeah</p>
    <p>I'm in love, yeah.</p>
    <p> I replayed this moment for months alone in my head, waitin' for it to come  
    <br>I wrote all your lines in the scripts in my mind, and I hope that you follow it for once </p>
    
        <p>I imagine myself in satin, the room was platinum and gold
    <br>I'd dance and catch your eye, you'll be mesmerized, oh
    <br>We'd find a corner, then your hands in my hair
    Finally we're here, so, why
    <br>Are you sayin' you got a flight, need an early night?
    No, don't go yet</p>
    
    <p> Oh, yeah, don't go yet, don't go yet
    <br>Oh, yeah, don't go yet, don't go yet
    <br>Oh, yeah, don't go yet, don't go yet</p>
    <br> What you leavin' for, when my night is yours?
    Just a little more, don't go yet</p>
    
    <p>Baby, don't go yet, 'cause I wore this dress for <br>a lil' drama
    <br>And I bet, I bet that you think that you know, <br>but you don't
    <br> Baby, come to mama
    <br>I get, I get what I want when I want
    <br>And I get it how I wanna, wanna
    <br>And I want you baby, gotta get you, baby </p>
    
    <p>We'd find a corner, then your hands in my hair
    Finally we're here, so, why
    <br> Are you sayin' you got a flight, need an early night?
    <br>No, don't go yet</p>
    
    <p> Oh, yeah, don't go yet, don't go yet
    <br>Oh, yeah, don't go yet, don't go yet (No, no)
    <br>Oh, yeah, don't go yet, don't go yet
    <br>What you leavin' for, when my night is yours?
    Just a little more, don't go yet</p>
    
    <p>Come along!</p>
    <p>La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la (Don't go yet)</p>
    <p>La-la-la-la-la-la-la, hey (Don't go yet)</p>
    <p>Hey!</p>

    <br>(Oh-no-no, don't leave yet) Ahora voy yo
    (No te vayas, quedate)

    <br>(No te vayas, quedate) Know you really wanna
    <br>(Oh-no-no, don't leave yet) Stay a little longer
    (No te vayas, quedate) Oh</p>
    
    <p>Oh, yeah, don't go yet, don't go yet (Oh)
    <br>Oh, yeah, don't go yet, don't go yet (Oh, don't go yet)
    <br>Oh, yeah, don't go yet, don't go yet (Oh)
    (Oh-no-no, don't leave yet) 
    <br> What you leavin' for, when my night is yours?
    Just a little more</p>
    <p>What you leavin' for, when my night is yours? (Yours, yours)
